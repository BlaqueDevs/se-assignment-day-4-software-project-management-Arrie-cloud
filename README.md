# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
  -Timely delivery is crucial to ensure client satisfaction as well as to stay within budget.
  - project managers can meet their deadlines through project monitoring and control, resource control and effective communication
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
  -effective cost control ensures that the project is complited within the set budget and strategies that prevent budget overrun include: Developing a budget plan and allocation of resources based on project needs and priorities.
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
  -Agile is iterative and empasizes on flexibility while waterfall is linear and each phase must be completed before the next one begins
  Advantages of Agile: improves team collaboration, there's regular customer feedback and a quick response to changes.
  Diadavantages of Agile: requires significant customer involvement through giving feedback and it is less predictable

  Advantages of waterfall: Easier to manage due to it's rigidity and has clear documentation and structure.
  Disadvantages of waterfall: testing occurs late in the process and it is difficult to accomodate changes.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
  -agile is most beneficial on projects where iterative progress is crucial e.g product development where customer feedback is required.
  - waterfall is beneficial for projects that follow well defined phases/ requirements that are unlikely to change e.g construction 
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
  -quality can be met through ensuring ISO 9001  standards are met and practicing of quality control and quality assurance.
  - these are important as they ensure project deliverables meet the required standards and customers expectations are met.
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
  -the scope sets clear boundaries and expectations for the project leading to effective resources allocation and communication leading to a successful project.
  - WBS is a breakdown of a bigger project into smaller managable components to be carried out to accomplish the project objectives.
  - it is useful as it provides tasks clarity, resources planning and allocation, progress tracking and risk management.
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
  - A detailed project schedule offers clarity on task prioritization and resource allocation ensuring that the project progressess in the set tme and the budget it adhered to.
  - A Gantt chart provides visual representation of the projects schedule making it easier to track the project progress and easily identify any delays.
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
  - The webpage aims at empowering vulnerable and marginalized communities by providing accessible and affordable legal care.
  - The target audience faces injustices that lead to poor mental health and poor quality of life.
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
  -a well defined problem ensures that the solution being created will be satisfactory to the end users or investors.
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
  -A one stop solution hub for legal services that is also committed to icluding low income earners and marginalized groups.
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
  - user-friendly end to end digital legal consultations.
  - Real-time case tracking and updates through E-mail and SMS
  - Community engagement  and widespread legal awareness
  - Integration with judicial systems. 
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
-almost 50% of the target market have failed to be represented legally due to high court fees. this gives the webpage at least a 50% growth as we penetrate the market.
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
- market trends can tell the next big thing and understanding the legal trends within the country will enable us to stay on top of improvements and features to be added as the trends emerges.
